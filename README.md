# Omnidisksweeper Puppet Module for Boxen

This is a non-functioning puppet module to install omnidisksweeper.

I though this would be straightforward, but I've lost a few hours googling

## Usage

```puppet
include omnidisksweeper
```

## Required Puppet Modules

* `boxen`

## Development

See issue #1. I'm stuck.
